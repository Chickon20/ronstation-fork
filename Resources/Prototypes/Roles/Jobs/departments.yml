  - BlueshieldOfficer # Ronstation - BSO does NOT do a secoff's job.
  # however. BSO requires miscellaneous security contraband to do their bodyguarding job
  # instead of editing 300 items individually. or messing with the contraband abstract
  # BSO is treated as part of security.
  # NONE of the options are great.
  # BSO's role as a NOT SECURITY OFFICER will be enforced via bwoinks and the guidebook
  # if it becomes apparent that this solution won't cut it, i'll do something else.
  # i'm not even paid for this
